# Smart Shop Guard project
- A prototype of a smart automated shop that provides service, safety, and security, implemented using both **Arduino Uno** and **ESP8266** microcontrollers
- The project consists of four main systems: an **automatic cooling system**, a **firefighting system**, an **automatic entry detection system**, and a **security system** for intruder detection.

## Automatic entry detection system
This system is designed to detect customers approaching the shop using an **ultrasonic sensor** and automatically opens the door with a **servo motor**. The door remains open until the customer enters and then closes behind them, ensuring a seamless and secure entry process.

## Firefighting system
The firefighting system is designed to detect and respond to fire hazards immediately. It uses a **flame sensor** to detect the presence of fire. Once a fire is detected, a **buzzer** is activated to alert customers, and an **AC water pump** is turned on to extinguish the fire. The pump is connected to a **relay**, which amplifies the voltage from 5 to 12 volts, ensuring that the pump operates effectively.

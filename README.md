# Smart Shop Guard project
- A prototype of a smart automated shop that provides service, safety, and security, implemented using both Arduino Uno and ESP8266 microcontrollers
- The project consists of four main systems: an automatic cooling system, a firefighting system, an automatic entry detection system, and a security system for intruder detection.

## Automatic entry detection system
This system is designed to detect customers approaching the shop using an ultrasonic sensor and automatically opens the door with a servo motor. The door remains open until the customer enters and then closes behind them, ensuring a seamless and secure entry process.

# Main Project Folder
In the Main Project Folder, the full system has been implemented in **Python**. Also, a **Bash script** is added to run all the 3 programs in parallel. A **socket program** was used to implement a **keep-alive** system that checks the active connection between the cloud service and the system. You can find a video for the whole running system in the following section.
